Potentially interesting options are:

* <b>Skip randomly</b>: with this option checked, a small fraction of the runs will raise a SkippedOperation exception, indicating that the operation has been run successfully already.
* <b>Fail randomly</b>: with this option checked, a small fraction of runs will end in failure.
